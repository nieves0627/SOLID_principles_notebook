    "# **SOLID Principles: Improve Object-Oriented Design in Python**\n",
    "\n",
    "When you build a Python project usingÂ **object-oriented programming (OOP)**, planning how the different classes and objects will interact to solve your specific problems is an important part of the job. This planning is known asÂ [object-oriented design (OOD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_design), and getting it right can be a challenge. If youâ€™re stuck while designing your Python classes, then theÂ **SOLID principles**Â can help you out.\n",
    "SOLID is a set of five object-oriented design principles that can help you write more maintainable, flexible, and scalable code based on well-designed, cleanly structured classes. \n",

    "## 1. **Single-Responsibility Principle (SRP)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The single-responsibility principle states that:\n",
    "\n",
    "> A class should have only one reason to change.\n",
    "> \n",
    "\n",
    "This means that a class should have only oneÂ **responsibility**, as expressed through its methods. If a class takes care of more than one task, then you should separate those tasks into separate classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This principle is closely related to the concept ofÂ [separation of concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns), which suggests that you should split your programs into different sections. Each section must address a separate concern.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate the single-responsibility principle and how it can help you improve your object-oriented design, say that you have the followingÂ `FileManager`Â class:\n",
